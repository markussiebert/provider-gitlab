# provider-gitlab

## Overview

`provider-gitlab` is the Crossplane infrastructure provider for
[Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/). The provider that is built from the source code
in this repository can be installed into a Crossplane control plane and adds the
following new functionality:

* Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that model Gitlab resources
* Controllers to provision these resources in Github based on the users desired
  state captured in CRDs they create
* Implementations of Crossplane's portable resource
  abstractions, enabling
  Gitlab resources to fulfill a user's general need for Gitlab configurations
